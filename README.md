This proxy compiler is my current project that Iâ€™ve been working on. It allows users to quickly compile a list of proxies and test 
the connection based off their project needs.  This program also allows users to check the proxy list to ensure connection when testing. 
So far, I have implemented direct connection verification for both the US an UK and the ability to test the direct connection of passed 
in .txt files.
